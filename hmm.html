    <h3>Standard</h3>

    <p>This is the original format of HMM and uses a primary script, <strong>hmm</strong>
        which references any scripts found in the <em>.hmm</em> sub-directory. It also includes
        a <em>hmm.bash</em> to provide BASH auto-completion.</p>

    <h3>Minified</h3>

    <p>This is the more recent edition and removes the use of the external script folder
        with the intention of gaining greater portability. Using this script, build systems
        and other automation can maintain a single download with no additional artifacts to
        manage.</p>

    <h2 id="usage" class="link_target">Usage</h2>

    <h3>Getting Started</h3>

    <h4>Requirements</h4>

    <p>HMM assumes that docker is at least installed correctly before it is used, so
        please consult your platform or libraries preferences on installing docker. GIT is
        also used by HMM but is not part of the core so as not considered a requirement for
        normal operation.</p>

    <h4 id="install" class="link_target">Installation</h4>

    <p>HMM provides a utility installer in it's beta phase until distribution channels are
        better identified for a tool of its nature. An updating feature may be added but plans
        included utilizing any typical distribution means to install and update in post 1.0
        releases. Post 1.0, the installer and related features may or may not be supported.</p>

    <pre><code>$ hmm install</code></pre>

    <p>The installation performs 3 simple tasks, copying HMM and associated assets to a new
        home where it can be reached by everyone if using global, or just in your user home if
        selecting local, then linking the executable script and the bash completion to their
        appropriate locations. HMM will prompt to replace at any step if existing assets are
        found unless the <strong>--force|-F</strong> option is provided.</p>

    <pre><code>
        $ hmm install
        -[CFZ]- Headworks Machination Management - v
        What type of installation? (l)ocal, (g)lobal g
        Installing from /home/comfreeze/bin/hmm to /usr/local/lib
        [sudo] password for (user):
        /usr/local/lib/hmm exists, clean it first (y/n)? y
        /etc/bash_completion.d/hmm exists, clean it first (y/n)? y
        /usr/local/bin/hmm exists, clean it first (y/n)? y
    </code></pre>

    <h4>Super User Privileges</h4>

    <p>HMM attempts to utilize <em>sudo</em> only when absolutely necessary (nsenter) and will
        prompt for that password during use if it is required to continue.</p>

    <h3 id="config" class="link_target">Create config</h3>

    <p>To get started, you'll probably want a configuration file. HMM was built to include
        real-time usage support but this heavily tested. Rather, HMM supports a simplified
        configuration philosophy. Using a fix set of common definitions and shared amongst a
        library of short hand tools, HMM provides users a rapid tool without the requirements of
        other languages outside of a SH/BASH environment.</p>

    <p>If you don't have a configuration file, you can initialize one using <strong>init</strong>
        option. By default, HMM will load two configuration files, <em>~/.hmm/local.hmm</em> and
        <em>./config.hmm</em> (where . is the current directory). You may specify a different
        configuration file using the <strong>--config|-c</strong> arguments.</p>

    <pre><code>$ hmm -c myConfig.hmm init</code></pre>

    <p>As of this writing, that should provide the following configuration template:</p>
    <pre><code>
        # Parent docker registry name for spawning/reference
        PARENT="${PARENT}"

        # Docker registry address (if not port 80, specify port)
        REGISTRY="$REGISTRY"

        # Base repository in the registry
        BASE="$BASE"

        # Target on the repository, version in big repos, tags in small
        TAG="$TAG"

        # Environment variable to inject (prefix each with -e ). Format is "-e name=value".
        ENV_VARS="$ENV_VARS"

        # Volumes/directories to mount/expose (prefix each with -v ). Format is "-v (local:)internal" and only
        exposed if local is not provided.
        VOLUMES="$VOLUMES"

        # Ports to forward/manage/redirect (prefix each with -p ). Format is "-p (local:)port" where local is
        dynamic if not provided.
        PORTS="$PORTS"

        # Default username used in operations requiring one specified.
        CONTAINER_USER="$CONTAINER_USER"
    </code></pre>

    <h3 id="start" class="link_target">Ready, set, CONTAIN!</h3>

    <p>After a config is generated, there are no special markings and it can be copied as plain
        text and edited for additional template files as needed. These configuration files are a
        simple collection of shell constant definitions, named to imply relationship and comments
        provided in the generated files (from <em>init</em>).</p>

    <p>There are a few ways you can start the container from this point, the first and most obvious
        being <strong>start</strong></p>

    <pre><code>$ hmm start</code></pre>

    <p>Or alternatively with a config named SomethingQUIrky.hmm:</p>

    <pre><code>$ hmm -c SomethingQUIrky.hmm start</code></pre>

    <p>It's important to note that due to the nature of it's design, the configuration parameter
        (--config|-c) should be passed first if used. Other commands may not provide appropriate
        insulation if read first to prevent pre-config actions from taking place.</p>

    <h4 id="update" class="link_target">Updating</h4>

    <p>Updating docker containers typically involves replacing them in some way. Since a docker
        container is usually designed to encapsulate a given environment snapshot, updates are typically
        replacing a previous environment snapshot with a more updated version. In large ecosystems,
        multiple containers may be active and several rotated out during a rolling update to provide
        high availability while maintaining continuous delivery principles in a perfect scenario.</p>

    <h4>So... updating?</h4>

    <p>A common practice, and the most common method for utilizing HMM to start a system, is the
        <strong>reload</strong> action. Reload will stop any current containers actively running
        which may present conflict on start fresh copies under named aliases. Once stopped, if one
        was indeed running, the previous image will be destroyed. If both operations are successful,
        the new image will be started in the former's location under it's shared alias/tag/name. This
        is a common scenario while building and testing new docker recipes and configurations.</p>

    <p>Common usage will maintain multiple tags at a given container image history, with at least
        one indicative of the specific versions contained in the recipe and another conveying a top
        level classification as "latest". Typically, docker works on images, so tagging an image after
        startup may not present the expected machine, especially when volumes have been referenced.
        HMM helps to make the process simpler by offering <strong>tag</strong> and <strong>snapshot</strong>
        helper actions.</p>

    <h4 id="stop" class="link_target">Stopping</h4>

    <p>If a container needs to be stopped, <strong>stop</strong> will pause the machine in a
        shutdown state but not lost to local docker histories. If a machine is lingering and needs
        cleaning, <strong>kill</strong> will attempt to remove the container and any related, unused
        images. If a container should be started again from a previously stopped point, <strong>restart</strong>
        will take care of that need.</p>

    <h4 id="share" class="link_target">Sharing/Moving/Copying</h4>

    <p>If a container needs to be shared, the most obvious method is the registry. A private
        registry can be used and was, in fact, part of the inspiration in hmm's original creation.
        The public registry is default without specification of any registry value, if using a private
        registry on a custom port provide it in the format as in docker for the config with the port
        suffixed to the host joined via colon. For example:</p>

    <pre><code>private_registry:8383/my-custom-container:v1_1</code></pre>

    <p>For a more simplistic approach without network requirements, <strong>export</strong> and
        <strong>import</strong> will operate using <em>tar</em> archives. The naming of these methods
        may present confusion when referenced against their docker equivalents but provided a more
        concise representation of how they operate in the hmm ecosystem, not docker's. The export
        action support and optional second param for the output filename but will append a .tar suffix
        on anything provided so users are not required to know which extension is necessary if changed.</p>
